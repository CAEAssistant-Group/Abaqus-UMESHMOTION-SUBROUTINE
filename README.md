# Abaqus-UMESHMOTION-SUBROUTINE
In this project, we provide you with the Abaqus UMESHMOTION subroutine, written in Fortran. The UMESHMOTION subroutine in Abaqus allows you to define Mesh Motion constraints during adaptive meshing. This is a basic version of the UMESHMOTION subroutine, which is attached here. However, we offer a more comprehensive package on this subroutine, as shown in the figure below, available on our website. You can access the full package from the link on the right side.

The full package includes a detailed guide on the UMESHMOTION subroutine, with several workshops.

One of these workshops, demonstrates tire tread wear simulation using the UMESHMOTION subroutine, as illustrated in the following figure.
